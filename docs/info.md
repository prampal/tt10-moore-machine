## How it works

A Moore machine is a type of finite state machine where the output is
solely determined by its current state. This means that the output
changes only when the machine transitions to a new state.

## How to test

To check if a Moore machine is working correctly, you need to verify
that its output changes based on the current state, not the current
input, and that the output is consistent with the state transitions
defined in its state diagram. You can do this by simulating the machine
with various inputs and observing the corresponding outputs, or by
implementing the machine in hardware or software and testing its
behavior
